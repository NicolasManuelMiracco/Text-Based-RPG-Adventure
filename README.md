# Text-Based-RPG-Adventure

One-line description: A Java-based text RPG where players encounter treasures or battle monsters using a rock-paper-scissors mechanism.

Summary: This Java program creates an interactive text-based RPG where the player encounters either a treasure or a monster in a series of rooms. The game continues until the player finds a treasure, which ends the game, or battles monsters using a rock-paper-scissors combat system. The player's and monster's choices are compared to determine the winner of each round. The game requires the player to win two out of three rounds to defeat the monster. Input validation ensures that players enter a valid choice (rock, paper, or scissors), and the game provides feedback after each round and at the end of each encounter. The program uses the Scanner class for input and the Random class for determining game events and monster choices.
